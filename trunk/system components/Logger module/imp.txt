2. log.h and log.cpp are the common files which is a wrapper above log4cxx library and provides the following functionalities:
	> initialize with a defined level
	> check for the existence of carbon.trace file in the user area temp folder. if it is present, the log level is set at trace
	> sets the format of the logging
	> takes the log file name which is to be created. 
	> takes the module name as the input parameter and initialize the logger object with that name.
	> its a singleton class <-- need to think on this. why to make it a singleton class.


	> it will check for the carbon.buffer file in the temp location to disable the buffered logging. 

3. every function will use the singleton object to get the logger object. Then it always prepends the name of the function 
e.g. 	[getTempFolderLocation] in front of the logging string so that the logging origin can be determined easily.
